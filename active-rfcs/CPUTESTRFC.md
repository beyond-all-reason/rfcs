The goal is to have 
    1. a CPU score for each player 
    2. CPU scores will be in the lobby system

how this would be achieved
1. a test that can be run in the new lobby, even when a player is inside of a multiplayer room
1. a CPU test that assumes a base level of load for a normal match 
1. the test results would be public to a persons account 


this allows for
    1. players who wish to push the game's performance during a match can understand what they can reasonably push in the match

    2.players with bad scores would be aware that they will lag behind first before other players

*Issue with CPU median*

1. CPU median is dependent on the differences between CPU's
    a. a high variance between CPU's lead to players with bad CPU's lagging behind far faster than if the variance is low
    

issues with implementing a CPU's scoring system
    1. players will prevent bad CPU's from playing in matches
        a. faf community has this issue it depends on the host of the lobby in question (community self regulation)
    2. possible user toxicity to low scoring CPU




side note of point 1.
1. faf community also uses ping as a means to self moderate lobbies as that also affects match performance(sometimes far greater than CPU score itself in terms of impact)
2. faf community also uses player rating and uncertainty to self moderate

side note of point 2
Ancedotal evidence from drivver44. 
1. its rare to see player toxicity occur
2. when player toxicity has occured its because issues arised from a specific player lagging the game
a. this can be the result of a low cpu score however it can be a factor of an interent system (ping or bad connection to another player)
